## Experience


### G2 Software Systems, Inc — Software Engineer I
##### May 2019 – Present

In support of the ALERT! Project, a DoD program and a global emergency notification and awareness system. Primary technologies include C#, MVC Framework, JavaScript, jQuery, Jenkins, Google Firebase.

1. Improve existing Cloud Platform services using event driven architecture to reduce monthly data transfer costs by over two-thirds per user.
2. Lead an automation effort which resulted in increased unit test coverage from 11% to 85%.
3. Designed a software component following OAuth 2.0 Specifications to authenticate users without access to a Common Access Card, reducing unnecessary server validation and requests.
